This repository contains the code for Entree, a social recipe-sharing web application. 

Entree has a user database backed by remote AWS SQL server and features a customized HTML/CSS GUI that displays recipes of you and your followers. Users can food recipes to their account for their followers to see by providing the name, ingredients, instructions, and picture related to that recipe. Once logged in, users will be directed to the main page where they can view recipes that they and their followers have uploaded. Users may find and follow additional users by searching for those users' names in the search bar. In addition, users can find recipes that include specific ingredients by enterring those ingredients into the search bar. Entree has multithreading capability that updates a user's main feed in real time. Besides the main feed, each user can access a featured feed which has recipes that were selected by the creators of Entree and a personal page, which displays recipes that user has uploaded.

Entree also features a guest mode, in which guests can view featured recipes and search for recipes and users.
